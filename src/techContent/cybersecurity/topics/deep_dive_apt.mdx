# Cyber Security Deep Dive: Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)

## Overview
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, targeted attacks by well-funded adversaries (often nation-states) aiming for long-term access and data exfiltration.

## Attack Lifecycle
1. **Reconnaissance:** Gather intelligence on the target.
2. **Initial Compromise:** Phishing, zero-day exploits, or supply chain attacks.
3. **Establish Foothold:** Deploy malware/backdoors for persistent access.
4. **Lateral Movement:** Move within the network using stolen credentials.
5. **Data Exfiltration:** Stealthily transfer sensitive data out.
6. **Maintain Presence:** Use multiple persistence mechanisms.

## Real-World Example
- The SolarWinds attack (2020) where attackers compromised a software vendor to access U.S. government and Fortune 500 networks.

## Detection & Response
- Use threat intelligence feeds and behavioral analytics.
- Hunt for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK).
- Implement network segmentation and least privilege.
- Regularly review logs and monitor for unusual activity.

## Hands-On Lab: Simulated APT Attack
1. Set up a test network with multiple virtual machines.
2. Simulate a phishing attack to gain initial access.
3. Use open-source tools (e.g., Cobalt Strike, Metasploit) for lateral movement.
4. Detect the attack using SIEM and EDR tools.
5. Practice incident response and remediation.

## Interview Q&A
**Q: What distinguishes an APT from other attacks?**
A: APTs are highly targeted, stealthy, and persistent, often involving multiple attack vectors and long dwell times.

**Q: How can organizations defend against APTs?**
A: Defense in depth, continuous monitoring, threat hunting, and rapid incident response.
