# Cyber Security Deep Dive: Security Operations Center (SOC) Automation

## Overview
Modern SOCs leverage automation (SOAR) to accelerate detection, response, and remediation of security incidents, reducing analyst fatigue and improving outcomes.

## Automation Use Cases
1. **Phishing Response:** Automatically isolate affected mailboxes, block malicious senders, and notify users.
2. **Malware Containment:** Quarantine endpoints, collect forensic data, and trigger remediation scripts.
3. **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Enrich alerts with IoCs from threat feeds and automate blocking of malicious IPs/domains.
4. **Incident Ticketing:** Auto-generate and update tickets in ITSM systems based on incident severity.

## Real-World Example
- A financial institution uses SOAR to reduce mean time to respond (MTTR) to phishing attacks from hours to minutes.

## Hands-On Lab: Building a SOAR Playbook
1. Use a SOAR platform (e.g., Splunk SOAR, Cortex XSOAR, or open-source alternatives).
2. Create a playbook to automate phishing response: ingest alert, extract IoCs, isolate mailbox, notify user, and close ticket.
3. Simulate an alert and observe automated actions.

## Best Practices
- Regularly review and update playbooks.
- Integrate with SIEM, EDR, and ticketing systems.
- Monitor automation for false positives/negatives.
