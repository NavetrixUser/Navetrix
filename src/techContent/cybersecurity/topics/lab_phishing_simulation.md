# Cyber Security Hands-On Lab: Simulated Phishing Campaign

## Objective
Experience the process of planning, executing, and analyzing a simulated phishing attack to improve organizational awareness and defenses.

## Lab Setup
- Use GoPhish (https://getgophish.com/) or a similar open-source phishing framework.
- Set up a test email environment (never use real user data for ethical reasons).

## Lab Exercises
1. **Campaign Planning:**
   - Design a realistic phishing email (e.g., fake password reset).
   - Create a landing page to capture credentials (in a safe, test environment).
2. **Execution:**
   - Launch the campaign to test users in the lab environment.
   - Track who clicks links and submits data.
3. **Analysis:**
   - Review results and identify users who fell for the attack.
   - Provide targeted training and awareness.

## Best Practices
- Always obtain written permission before running any phishing simulation.
- Use results to improve security training, not to punish users.

## Interview Q&A
**Q: What is the purpose of a phishing simulation?**
A: To assess and improve user awareness and organizational resilience to phishing attacks.

**Q: How should results be used?**
A: To guide training and improve security culture, not for punitive action.
