# AWS Case Study: Serverless Event Processing

## Scenario
A media company needs to process and analyze thousands of images uploaded daily. They want a scalable, cost-effective solution using AWS serverless services.

## Steps Taken
1. **S3 Bucket:** Store uploaded images.
2. **Lambda Functions:** Triggered by S3 events to process images (e.g., resize, tag, analyze).
3. **DynamoDB:** Store metadata and analysis results.
4. **SNS/SQS:** Notify downstream systems or trigger further processing.
5. **Monitoring:** Use CloudWatch for logs and alerts.

## Hands-On Lab: Building a Serverless Pipeline
1. Create an S3 bucket and upload sample images.
2. Write a Lambda function to process images on upload.
3. Store results in DynamoDB.
4. Set up SNS notifications for completed processing.
5. Monitor with CloudWatch.

## Best Practices
- Use IAM roles with least privilege.
- Monitor and log all serverless activity.
- Test for scalability and error handling.

## Interview Q&A
**Q: What are the benefits of serverless architectures?**
A: Scalability, cost efficiency, and reduced operational overhead.

**Q: How do you secure AWS Lambda functions?**
A: Use IAM roles, environment variable encryption, and VPC integration.
