# Google Cloud Case Study: Big Data Analytics Pipeline

## Scenario
A retail chain wants to analyze sales and customer data from multiple stores in real time using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Ingestion:** Use Cloud Pub/Sub to stream data from stores.
2. **Data Processing:** Use Dataflow for ETL and transformation.
3. **Storage:** Store processed data in BigQuery for analytics.
4. **Visualization:** Use Data Studio to create dashboards.
5. **Security:** Apply IAM roles and audit logs.

## Hands-On Lab: Building a Big Data Pipeline
1. Set up Pub/Sub topics and simulate data streams.
2. Create a Dataflow job for ETL.
3. Load data into BigQuery.
4. Build a dashboard in Data Studio.
5. Apply IAM policies and review audit logs.

## Best Practices
- Use managed services for scalability.
- Secure data at rest and in transit.
- Monitor and optimize pipeline performance.

## Interview Q&A
**Q: What is BigQuery?**
A: A fully managed, serverless data warehouse for analytics at scale.

**Q: How do you secure data pipelines in GCP?**
A: Use IAM, encryption, and audit logging.
