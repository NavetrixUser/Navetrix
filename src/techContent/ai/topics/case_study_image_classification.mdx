# AI Case Study: Image Classification with Deep Learning

## Scenario
A healthcare startup wants to automate the detection of pneumonia in chest X-ray images using AI.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Collection:** Gather labeled X-ray images.
2. **Preprocessing:** Resize, normalize, and augment images.
3. **Model Selection:** Use a convolutional neural network (CNN) with TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Training:** Train the model on the dataset, validate, and tune hyperparameters.
5. **Deployment:** Export the model and deploy as a REST API for hospital integration.

## Hands-On Lab: Training an Image Classifier
1. Download a public chest X-ray dataset (e.g., from Kaggle).
2. Preprocess and split the data.
3. Build and train a CNN using Keras.
4. Evaluate accuracy and visualize predictions.
5. Deploy the model with Flask or FastAPI.

## Best Practices
- Use data augmentation to prevent overfitting.
- Monitor for bias and validate with real-world data.
- Secure the API endpoint.

## Interview Q&A
**Q: What is a convolutional neural network?**
A: A deep learning model designed for processing grid-like data such as images.

**Q: How do you prevent overfitting in deep learning?**
A: Use data augmentation, dropout, and regularization.
