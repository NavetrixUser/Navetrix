# GenAI Case Study: Generating Marketing Copy with LLMs

## Scenario
A marketing agency wants to use generative AI to create engaging product descriptions and ad copy for clients.

## Steps Taken
1. **Prompt Engineering:** Design prompts to guide the LLM (e.g., GPT-4) for specific tone and style.
2. **Fine-Tuning:** Optionally fine-tune the model on client-specific data.
3. **Content Generation:** Use the LLM API to generate multiple versions of copy.
4. **Review & Edit:** Human review for accuracy, compliance, and brand voice.
5. **A/B Testing:** Deploy different versions and analyze engagement metrics.

## Hands-On Lab: Generating Copy with OpenAI API
1. Sign up for OpenAI or similar LLM provider.
2. Use Python to send prompts and receive generated text.
3. Experiment with prompt variations for tone and length.
4. Review and edit outputs for quality.
5. Analyze which copy performs best in a simulated campaign.

## Best Practices
- Always review AI-generated content for accuracy and compliance.
- Use clear, specific prompts for best results.
- Monitor for bias and inappropriate outputs.
